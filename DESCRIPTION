Description: glmSparseNet is an R-package that generalizes sparse regression models when the features (e.g. genes)
             have a graph structure (e.g. protein-protein interactions), by including network-based regularizers. 
             glmSparseNet uses the glmnet R-package, by including centrality measures of the network as penalty 
             weights in the regularization. The current version implements regularization based on node degree, 
             i.e. the strength and/or number of its associated edges, either by promoting hubs in the solution or 
             orphan genes in the solution. All the glmnet distribution families are supported, namely "gaussian", 
             "poisson", "binomial", "multinomial", "cox", and "mgaussian".
